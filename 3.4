# A year with 366 days is called a leap year. Leap years are necessary to keep the calendar
# synchronized with the sun because the earth revolves around the sun once
# every 365.25 days. Actually, that figure is not entirely precise, and for all dates after
# 1582 the Gregorian correction applies. Usually years that are divisible by 4 are leap
# years, for example 1996. However, years that are divisible by 100 (for example, 1900)
# are not leap years, but years that are divisible by 400 are leap years (for exam ple,
# 2000). Write a program that asks the user for a year and computes whether that year
# is a leap year. Use a single  if statement and Boolean operators.

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

leapYear = False

if (year % 100 != 0 and year % 4 == 0) or year % 400 == 0:
    leapYear = True
