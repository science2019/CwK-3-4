# Write a program that prompts the user for two integers and then prints
# • The sum
# • The difference
# • The product
# • The average
# • The distance (absolute value of the difference)
# • The maximum (the larger of the two)
# • The minimum (the smaller of the two)
# Hint: Python defines  max and  min functions that accept a sequence of values, each
# separated with a comma.
